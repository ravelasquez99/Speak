# Overall
**I really appreciated working on this project.** I decided to spend a good chunk of the time on the UIKit side.

I honestly hadn't touched UIKit since my Meta days (More than 4 years ago). I probably spent more time than I should have but I am of the mindset of "do it well or not at all". Plus, I got to brush up on those skills.

# About Screen 1
**I focused on writing clean, easy to understand, and well-structured code.** Wherever I took shortcuts or would have normally done things differently, I tried to call it out.

I wanted to give you all a sense of my dedication to well-crafted code. I believe code is designed to be written once, and read thousands of times. Would love to dive into this more during my next interview.

Architecturally, I decided I wanted a tableview structure with a hero banner at the top. I chose this but I also considered just one long tableview.

I also build out a mock class for colors, added SDWebimage for a dependency (although I did not handle image loading or failure to load states).

**Callouts:**

I did not really focus on fonts, accessibility or localization. All things that would be needed in a production app
