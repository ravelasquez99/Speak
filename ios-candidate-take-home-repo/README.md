# Instructions

Please provide a working Xcode project using git along with a README file describing the architecture and any caveats/compromises due to time constraints. 

You can email tommy@speak.com if you need any clarification on the task.

Share the private github repo with the following github usernames:
* tc
* adhsu
* crtgregoric
* ekranac
* TElkoSpeak

This project will consists of two screens:

1. Course screen that shows the course summary (course info, units, and days)

2. A simulated Speech to Text record screen that communicates with the server via a websocket connection.

Also use the [Speak app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speak-스픽/id1286609883) as a design inspiration but feel free to change things up.

Try making the course screen look nice. The provided JSON (`assets/course.json`) should be used as the datasource for the app.

## Screens breakdown:

### 1. Course screen
<img src="./example-screenshots/course-screen.png" alt="course screen" width="200"/>

Components:
- Implement this using **UIKit**.
- header with course info composed of a thumbnail image, a title label and a subtitle label showing the number of days in this course
- unit section header with a unit number label formatted as "Unit {unit number}"
- unit day item displaying the day number, thumbnail image, day title and day subtitle

Clicking on ANY Day will take you to the Record screen.

### 2. Record screen

<img src="./example-screenshots/record-screen.png" alt="record screen" width="200"/>

Implement this using SwiftUI

On this record screen, you will have a main "upload" button which will stream an audio wav data in base 64 encoding to our websocket endpoint

The response events will contain the text of the audio being uploaded.

For the sample audio, the output text should be ``This is not what we ordered``


#### Websocket specification:

Websocket host: `wss://speak-api--feature-mobile-websocket-interview.preview.usespeak.dev/v2/ws` 

- When connecting to the WebSocket, `x-access-token: DFKKEIO23DSAvsdf` and `x-client-info: Speak Interview Test` headers should be set.

Once the connection is established, you will *send and receive JSON strings*.

You need to send `asrStart` event to start the streaming session.

An example of `asrStart` event you can send is:
```
{
    type: "asrStart",
    learningLocale: 'en-US',
    metadata: {
        deviceAudio: {
            inputSampleRate: 16000,
        },
    },
}
```

If the websocket connection already has a streaming session connected to it, it will return `asrError` event otherwise it will return `asrMetadata` event. See below for the example JSON.

```
{
    type: "asrMetadata",
    id: "stringId",
    recordingId: "stringId",
}
```

If asr is already active it will return exception event
```
{
	type: "asrError",
	message: "streamingSessionAlreadyExists"
}
```

If you get the session already exists exception, you can close current session using the following event and then try starting new session

```
{
	type: "asrClose"
}
```

Once the session is ended or closed by sending the `asrClose` event, the client will receive the following event

```
{
	type: "asrClosed"
}
```

The `asrClosed` event indicates that the streaming session has been ended, and a new one has to be started using `asrStart`.

Once the session is initiated(after the `asrMetadata` event), we can start streaming data using the following event:

```
{
	type: "asrStream",
	chunk: "XXXX", // base64 encoding of the WAV data
	isFinal: false
}
```
*NOTE: This stream data is already provided for you in `assets/asr-stream-audio-chunks.json`*

When sending the last chunk, `isFinal` flag should be set to true. This will end the asr streaming session and new one can be started after that.

If startAsr event hasnt been called prior it will return this exception event :
```
{
	type: "asrError",
	message: "streamingSessionDoesNotExist"
}
```

While streaming, API will be sending ASR result events with following type:
```
{
	id: "",
	type: "asrResult",
	text: "text from audio"
	isFinal: false
}
```
Display the ``text`` attribute in large characters in the record screen.

## Included assets
- icons that you could use for the UI
- JSON that serves as the app data source (`assets/course.json`)
- audio stream encoded in base64 represented as a JSON array (`assets/asr-stream-audio-chunks.json`)

## Judging Criteria

You will be evaluated based on:
* correctness
* visual implementation
* edge case handling
* architecture
* directory / files structure
* git workflow(eg, meaningful commit messages)
